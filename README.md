1) Employeee.py creates an HTML table displaying employee data retrieved from a GET request on an API endpoint. The table should be ordered by total hours worked, and less than 100 hours should be colored.











2) Employee_pie_chart.py requires the applicant to generate a PNG file displaying a pie chart using data from the same REST endpoint. The pie chart should display the employee's percentage of total time worked.
